## What Happens On Television Should Stay On Television!!!

We all have noticed an annoying box with a cancel button at its rightmost corner. Want to know how u can deal with them...let's start!
Ads are online advertising, also called online marketing or Internet advertising or web advertising, which is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. Consumers have to view online advertising as an unwanted distraction.

Ads are the means through which many marketing companies earn a lot of profit by wasting our internet data and our most precious time.

Why are ads 'annoying'?
Advertising is usually annoying. It's designed to be that way.
Any site that we visit, applications that we download, or videos that we play online, have so many annoying ads which consume our internet bandwidth and also our precious time.
One 15 minute video on YouTube contains 3 ads costing 5 seconds each.

Many sites have malicious ads which on top of being annoying are also risky. Clicking knowingly or unknowingly on them may cause some unknown malware to automatically get installed on our system which slows down its performance to a very great extent.

I remember once one of my friends was trying to download some software which also led to the installation of an unknown malware that hid inside the system registry files. It took control of the web browser to continuously open multiple tabs on it. Luckily he was able to restore his system back to its normal state after a lot of fuss.
