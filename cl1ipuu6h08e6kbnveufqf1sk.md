## Introduction to JAVA

"Sharing what you learn solidifies what you learn."

Learning your first programing language can be quite a challenging task when you are just starting out to build your career in tech. When I started learning to code I started with python programing language because it has a very simple syntax and is easy to pick up but also because I never understood JAVA and its complicated syntax, because we have to write so many lines of code just to write a simple hello world program.
Here's an example of a simple "Hello World!" program in JAVA and python just to give you an idea of the syntax for both the language:

Python:

JAVA:

Did you see that? How easy it is to write code in python compared to JAVA. Just one single line printed our "Hello World!" in python whereas JAVA needs 8 freaking lines for the same thing.
Then why do we need JAVA or other languages with such lengthy and complicated syntax and why not python or some other programing language which has such simple syntax like python?
The answer to this question is that every single language or technology that has ever been created solves a real-life problem but none of those technologies are perfect. So to improve on the previous or outdated tech new tech is being created all the time and so today, we have numerous different programming languages and technologies, each of them serving its own purpose to help in solving some or the other real-life problem.

Knowing the fact that it gets so overwhelming to understand the whys and why nots while learning any programing language, I will share what I have learned so far while learning JAVA by breaking down my knowledge of every concept involved in this language through these blogs so that it gets easier for others to understand the underlying concepts.

I am also sharing the resource from where I am learning so that you can refer to it too and trust me you'll this is one of the best resources out there over the internet.

If you want to practice what you are learning then you can refer to this [GitHub repository by Kunal Kushwaha:](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java). This has some amazingly organized topic-wise LeetCode questions for interview perspective. You will also need a good code editor to practice what you are learning.
There are plenty of code editors out there but for JAVA it is recommended to use the IntelliJ idea which you can download from this link [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=windows) or if you want to use an online code editor then [repl.it](https://replit.com/~) would be your go-to online IDE. If you choose to use an offline code editor then you will have to install [JAVA](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java16) so make sure you do that too.

Sit tight once you are done setting up your work environment and we will get started from the very next blog.
